## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

To use this template, you'll need to clone it using a tool like `degit`, which allows you to easily clone repositories without the extra history.

In the example below, we'll use pnpm as our package manager, but you can use npm/bun/yarn if you prefer.

```bash
pnpx degit JohnC0de/nextshad-template myapp # You can change "myapp" to whatever you want
cd myapp # if you changed the name in the previous step, change it here too
pnpm install
```

This will clone the repository into a new folder on your machine and install all necessary dependencies.

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server, and you can begin working on your project.

## Customization

- **Themes**: You can customize the themes using shadcn-ui, visit the [Shadcn-UI docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming) for more information.
- **UI Components**: Customize Shadcn-UI and Radix-UI components in the respective component files.
- **TailwindCSS**: Tailor your styles in the Tailwind configuration file.
